# hpc-bench

hpc-bench is a benchmarking environment consisting of an integrated build
environment, runscripts and postprocessing. Its purpose is to provide a
unified environment for application benchmarks on HPC Clusters. It is derived
from the RRZEBench environment.

Features:

* Packagesystem for Benchmarks
* Integrated Buildsystem
* Runscript with extensive logging and automatic testcase execution
* Easy managment of multiple configurations
* Multiple runs on different systems can be performed in the same directory
* Postprocessing with automatic collection and presentation of results

The main purpose of hpc-bench is to be used for application benchmarking in HPC
cluster procurements. Still it can also be used to evaluate and compare new
architectures and HPC systems and to tune application codes.
